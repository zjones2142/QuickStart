# Quick Start for QuickStart for A Quick Start:
Add desired file paths to .py file and add .py file name to .bat file before running/starting

Note: If the files you want to open require administrator to open you must go into the programs properties and set as "always run as administrator." then create a shortcut to the .bat file and do the same in that files properties. You may need to move the file to the base directory for elevated command prompts, "System32". Alternatively you could add a 'cd' command to the .bat file in order to launch cmd in the files current directory.
